Overview
--------

In this digital twin validation example, debris-field wave-flume tests at a NHERI facility, Oregon State University's Large Wave Flume (OSU LWF), are briefly summarized before demonstrating the use of HydroUQ's OSU LWF digital twin paired with the Material Point Method (MPM).

Details for the experiments are available in various publications. Namely, the work of Andrew Winter [Winter2020]_ [Winter2019]_, Krishnendu Shekhar [Shekhar2020]_ and Dakota Mascarenas [Mascarenas2022]_ [Mascarenas2022PORTS]_.  The simulations replicated in this example appeared originally in Bonus 2023 [Bonus2023Dissertation]_.

Experiments were performed in the NHERI OSU LWF, a 100 meter long flume with adjustable bathymetry, in order to quantify stochastic impact loads of ordered and disordered debris-fields on effectively rigid, raised structure.

   NHERI OSU LWF facilty's experimental schematic used in this example. Adapted from Winter 2019 [Winter2019]_, and Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_.

This example may help to produce a robust database (numerical and physical) from which to eventually be able to extract both the first-principals of wave-driven debris-field phenomena and design guidelines on induced forces. 

We validate against two very similar (but not identical) physical studies done in the OSU LWF by [Shekhar2020]_ and [Mascarenas2022]_, indicating high accuracy of our model and low bias to minor experiment specifications. 

Results for free surface elevation and streamwise structural loads are to be recorded for validation at a specified interval. 

Qualitatively, an MPM simulation of debris impacts on a raised structure in the OSU LWF is shown below.

It appears similar in the mechanism of debris impact, stalling, and deflection relative to the structure and flow for a similar case in Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_.

The experiments by Shekhar et al. 2020 [Shekhar2020]_ are also shown below for comparison. These tests had a slightly different configuartion, primarily the debris were located 0.5 meters further upstream from the box and the water level was 0.10-0.15 meters lower than the 2.0 meter datum used in the simulations and Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_ experiments.

Set-Up
------

A step-by-step walkthrough on replicating an MPM simulation result from Bonus 2023 [Bonus2023Dissertation]_ is provided below.

Open ``Settings``. Here we set the simulation time, the time step, and the number of processors to use, among other pre-simulation decisions.

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Settings.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Settings GUI


Open ``Bodies`` / ``Fluid`` / ``Material``. Here we set the material properties of the fluid and the debris.

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Bodies_Fluid_Material.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Bodies Fluid Material GUI

Open ``Bodies`` / ``Fluid`` / ``Geometry``. Here we set the geometry of the flume, the debris, and the raised structure. 

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Bodies_Fluid_Geometry.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Bodies Fluid Geometry GUI


Open ``Algorithm``. Here we set the algorithm parameters for the simulation. We choose to apply F-Bar antilocking to aid in the pressure field's accuracy on the fluid. The associated toggle must be checked, and the antilocking ratio set to 0.9, loosely.

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Bodies_Fluid_Algorithm.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Bodies Fluid Algorithm GUI

Open ``Bodies`` / ``Fluid`` / ``Partitions``. Here we set the number of partitions for the simulation. This is the domain decomposition across discrete hardware units, i.e. Multi-GPUs. These may be kept as there default values. 

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Bodies_Fluid_Partitions.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Bodies Fluid Partitions GUI

Moving onto the creation of an ordered debris-array, we set the debris properties in the ``Bodies`` / ``Debris`` / ``Material`` tab. We will assume debris are made of HDPE plastic, as in experiments by Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_ and Shekhar et al. 2020 [Shekhar2020]_.

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Bodies_Debris_Material.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Bodies Debris Material GUI

Open ``Bodies`` / ``Debris`` / ``Geometry``. Here we set the debris properties, such as the number of debris, the size of the debris, and the spacing between the debris. Rotation is another option, though not used in this example. We've elected to use an 8 x 4 grid of debris (longitudinal axis parallel to long-axis of the flume).

   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Bodies Debris Geometry GUI

The ``Bodies`` / ``Debris`` / ``Algorithm`` and ``Debris`` / ``Partitions`` tabs are not used in this example, but are available for more advanced users.

Open ``Bodies`` / ``Structures``. Uncheck the box that enables this body, if it is checked. We will not model the structure as a body in this example, instead, we will modify it as a boundary later.

   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center
   
   HydroUQ Bodies Structures GUI

Open ``Boundaries`` / ``Wave Flume``. We will set the boundary to be a rigid body, with a fixed separable velocity condition, that is faithful to the digital tiwn of the NHERI OSU LWF. Bathmyetry joint points should be indetical to the ones used in ``Bodeis`` / ``FLuid``.

   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Boundaries Wave Flume Facility GUI

Open ``Boundaries`` / ``Wave Generator``. Fill in the appropriate file-path for the wave generator paddle motion. It is designed to produce near-solitary like waves.

   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center
   
   HydroUQ Boundaries Wave Generator GUI

Open ``Boundaries`` / ``Rigid Structure``. This is where we will specify the raised structure as a boundary condition. By doing so, we can determine exact loads on the rigid boundary grid-nodes, which may then be mapped to the FEM tab for nonlinear UQ structural response analysis.

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Boundaries_RigidStructure.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Boundaries Rigid Structure GUI

Open ``Boundaries`` / ``RigidWalls``.

   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center

   HydroUQ Boundaries Wave-Flume Facility GUI

Open ``Sensors`` / ``Wave Gauges``. Set the ``Use these sensor?`` box to ``True`` so that the simulation will output results for the instruments we set on this page.

Three wave gauges will be defined. The first is located prior to the bathymetry ramps, the second partially up the ramps, and the third near the the bathymetry crest, debris, and raised structure. 

Set the origins and dimensions of each wave as in the table below. To match experimental conditions, we also apply a 120 Hz sampling rate to the wave gauges, meaning they record data every 0.0083 seconds.

   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center
   
   HydroUQ Sensors Wave-Gauge GUI

These wave gauges will read all numerical bodies (i.e. particles) within their defined regions every sampling step, and will report the highest elevation value (Position Y) of a contained body as the free-surface elevation at that gauge. The results is written into our sensor results files.


Open ``Sensors`` / ``Load Cells``. Set the ``Use these sensor?`` box to ``True`` so that the simulation will output results for the instruments we set on this page.

.. figure:: figures/GUI_Sensors_LoadCells.PNG
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :figclass: align-center
   
   HydroUQ Sensors Load-Cells GUI


Open ``Outputs``. Here we set the non-physical output parameters for the simulation, e.g. attributes to save per frame and file extension types. The particle bodies' output frequency is set to 10 Hz (0.1 seconds), meaning the simulation will output results every 0.1 seconds. This is decent for animations without taking too much space. Fill in the rest of the data in the figure into your GUI to ensure all your outputs match this example.

Simulation
----------

We assume that 2 hours are reserved for your simulation. For those using the reduce fluid bulk modulus or reduced resolution, this may be more than neccesary.

This simulation was ran on the TACC Lonestar6 system. It uesd three NVIDIA A100 GPUs on a single node in the ``gpu-a100`` queue. Real time to complete was 2 hours. Simulated time in the digital twin is 26 seconds.

In order to retrieve results from the analysis, the analysis must complete and postprocess the model output files into an appropriate format before the end of the allotted submission time. 

.. important::
   Provide a large amount of time for the ``Max Run Time`` field in HydroUQ when submitting a job to ensure the model completes before the time allotted runs out! We recommend 2 hours in this example. 

.. warning::
   Only ask for what you need in terms of sensor size, count, and output sampling rate. Otherwise you will end up with massive amounts of data which can slow simulations due to I/O constraints.

Locate the zip folder and extract it somewhere convenient. The local or remote work directory on your computer is a good option, but note that these files may be erased if another simulation is set-up in HydroUQ, so keep a backup somewhere outside the working directories.
	
HydroUQ's sensor / probe / instrument output is available in ``{your_path_to_HydroUQ_WorkDir}/HydroUQ/RemoteWorkDir/results/`` as ``CSV`` files.

Particle geometry files often have a ``BGEO`` extension, open Side FX Houdini Apprentice (free to use) to look at MPM results in high-detail.

Once complete, the simulation data at the three wave gauges (WG1, WG2, and WG3, left-to-right) is as showm below when plotted against experimental trials of Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_ for the "unbroken" solitary wave case.

The simulation data at the load-cell is as shown below when plotted against experimental trials of Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_ for the "unbroken" solitary wave case. The experimental streamwise load is the combination of "LC5" and "LC8" in Mascarenas 2022 [Mascarenas2022]_, as both measured streamwise load on the box to reduce errors from position / slight box apparatus out-of-plane rotation.

Though only one case was considered here, if many experimental debris-field cases are ran (10+) we can use HydroUQ to perform a sensitivity analysis on the debris-field parameters. This isn't pursued here-in. 

However, the following box-and-whisker charts demonstrates the strengh of the numerical replication, as most points fall within experimental interquartile ranges and never outside of the experimental envelope for impact loads.
