    <h1> This is the Hydro Engineering with Uncertainty Quantification (Hydro-UQ) application.</h1>
    <p>
      This open-source research application, https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/HydroUQ, provides an application
      researchers can use to predict the response of a building to hydrodynamic events. The application is focused on
      quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the properties of the buildings and the events
      events are not known exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying assumptions in the numerical
      modeling of that structure. In the application the user is required to characterize the uncertainties in the input, the
      application will after utilizing the selected sampling method, provide information that characterizes the uncertainties in
      the response.
